description: "Use for requests involving pay-per-token foundation models, including Unity Gateway (fka Unity AI Gateway) model services, model provider services, MCP services, `system.ai` services, three-part Unity Catalog service names, or migration from legacy AI Gateway. Also use when a workload with Model Serving `CAN_QUERY` fails to access a Unity Gateway service. Not for legacy AI Gateway configuration attached to Model Serving endpoints; use databricks-model-serving for that."

# Unity Gateway

Use the parent `databricks-core` skill for CLI authentication and profile selection.

Unity Gateway provides Unity Catalog securables for governed access to AI services. The CLI
command group keeps the earlier product name: `databricks ai-gateway --help`.

## Choose the Correct Gateway

| Request | Use |
|---|---|
| Unity Gateway or Unity AI Gateway model service, MCP service, or model provider service | This skill and `databricks ai-gateway` |
| AI Gateway configuration on a Model Serving endpoint, including `put-ai-gateway` | `databricks-model-serving` and `databricks serving-endpoints` |
| Lakeflow Connect ingestion gateway | `databricks-lakeflow-connect` |

Treat **Unity AI Gateway** as an earlier name for **Unity Gateway** when the resource is a
Unity Catalog securable. Do not translate legacy Model Serving AI Gateway resources into
Unity Gateway resources unless the user explicitly requests a migration.

## CLI Workflow

Use the Databricks CLI for resource lifecycle and permission management. Do not substitute
direct REST calls or a Databricks SDK for those operations. Python clients are supported
for querying model and model provider services; read [Query services](references/querying.md).

An explicit request for **Unity Gateway**, **Unity AI Gateway**, or
`databricks ai-gateway` belongs to this skill. Do not switch to
`databricks-model-serving` merely because the request involves a model service or a
workspace. Use that skill only for a legacy per-endpoint AI Gateway operation or when a
provisioned-throughput destination requires Model Serving endpoint details.

1. Verify the CLI meets the minimum version:

   ```bash
   databricks --version
   ```

2. Inspect the command and the relevant operation before constructing a payload:

   ```bash
   databricks ai-gateway --help
   databricks ai-gateway <operation> --help
   ```

3. Pass create and update configuration through `--json`. Use an explicit profile when
   profile-based authentication is required:

   ```bash
   databricks ai-gateway <operation> --json @payload.json --profile <PROFILE>
   ```

Do not invent JSON fields from similarly named legacy APIs. Build the payload from the
installed CLI help and the Unity Gateway documentation for the selected service type.

## Service Types

| Service type | CLI operations |
|---|---|
| Model service | `create-model-service`, `get-model-service`, `list-model-services`, `update-model-service`, `delete-model-service`; read [Model services](references/model-services.md) |
| MCP service | `create-mcp-service`, `get-mcp-service`, `list-mcp-services`, `update-mcp-service`, `delete-mcp-service`; read [MCP services](references/mcp-services.md) |
| Model provider service | `create-model-provider-service`, `get-model-provider-service`, `list-model-provider-services`, `update-model-provider-service`, `delete-model-provider-service`; read [Model provider services](references/model-provider-services.md) |

## Querying and permissions

- Before writing Python that invokes a model or model provider service, read [references/querying.md](references/querying.md).
- Before checking, granting, or revoking Unity Gateway access, read [references/permissions.md](references/permissions.md).
- Before any model-service operation, read [references/model-services.md](references/model-services.md). It contains the current resource-name conventions, JSON payload fields, required-input gate, and lifecycle commands.
- Before any MCP-service operation, read [references/mcp-services.md](references/mcp-services.md) for the equivalent MCP-specific contract.
- Before any model-provider-service operation, read [references/model-provider-services.md](references/model-provider-services.md).

Do not fetch public documentation for fields already covered by these references. Consult the
authoritative documentation only when a required field is absent from the reference or the
user explicitly asks for the latest documentation. Do not assign a Beta or preview status
unless the installed CLI help or current documentation explicitly does so.

## Migration from Model Serving to Unity Gateway

When migrating from workspace-scoped Model Serving endpoints to Unity Catalog-scoped Unity Gateway services, read [references/model-serving-migration.md](references/model-serving-migration.md).
